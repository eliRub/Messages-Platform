# Messages-Platform
Implementation of a Message-Platform, without a UI (at least for now).

Pay attention that if you want to run this code, you need to add a file called .env to this project with the following information: 
  DB_USERNAME = ""
  DB_PASSWORD = ""
  DB_HOST = ""
  SENDER_EMAIL = ""
  SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD = ""
